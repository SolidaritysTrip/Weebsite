# Weebsite
A unique solo website project made by me to test off my web design skills and show off how much of a weeb i am  

## Feel free to edit and send me suggestion in the form of screenshots.
If i like it i will send you a pm and credit you for your work  

## Most of this was made with the Atom ide, offline.
However you will see updates from me in this readme so i can keep track of my progress  

### Updates:
0.0.1 AND 0.0.2 were updates that fixed some code, and cleaned up my files just a bit  
0.0.3, Patch 1 fixed links to the Q&A.html page, now named Discussion on the actual website.  
       Patch 2 fixed what was supposed to be links under pictures on the Index or Hub webpage, now you can click on them to navigate  
0.0.4, Patch 1 added NSFW page blocker for lewds.html, also added something to the fallback page if you click cancel  

#### Future Plans:
Create the lewd page, i want to get all the zip archives uploaded and available to download and want to also make it look nice while still having so much crammed in that page. I have to make a warning before the page is accessable describing that its NSFW, probably in javascript EX {
~~window.alert("Warning, This page is NSFW. Please go back if you're under 18"); }~~  
```
if (window.confirm("If you click OK, You are giving consent that you would like to see NSFW content")) {
window.location.href="LewdsRedirect.html";
};
```  
However the page may still be viewable when the message is up
