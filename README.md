A unique solo website project made by me to test off my web design skills and show off how much of a weeb i am

# Feel free to edit and send me suggestion in the form of screenshots.
If i like it i will send you a pm and credit you for your work

# Most of this was made with the Atom ide, offline.
However you will see updates from me in this readme so i can keep track of my progress

# Updates:
